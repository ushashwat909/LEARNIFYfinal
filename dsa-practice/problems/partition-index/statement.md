# Partition Index

## Problem Description

Given an integer array A of length N, considering the last element as pivot p, rearrange the elements such that for all i:

- if A[i] < p then it should be present on left side of the partition
- if A[i] > p then it should be present on right side of the partition

Rearrange the given array as well as return the partition index.

**Note:** All elements are distinct

## Problem Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵

1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10⁹

## Input Format

The only input argument is the given vector A.

## Output Format

Return the partition index as well as rearrange the input array to satisfy the given conditions.

## Example Input

**Input:**
```
A = [6, 2, 0, 4, 5]
```

## Example Output

**Output:**
```
Valid
A possible solution can be:
A = [2, 0, 4, 5, 6] and partitionIndex = 3
```

## Example Explanation

**Explanation:**

The rearrangement is valid because every element in [0, 2] index range is less than the pivot element, and every element in [3, 4] index range is greater than the pivot element.
