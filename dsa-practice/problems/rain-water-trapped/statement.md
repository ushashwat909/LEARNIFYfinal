# Rain Water Trapped

## Problem Description

Imagine a histogram where the bars' heights are given by the array A. Each bar is of uniform width, which is 1 unit. When it rains, water will accumulate in the valleys between the bars.

Your task is to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped in these valleys.

**Example:**

The Array A = [5, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 7] is visualized as below. The total amount of rain water trapped in A is 11.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 10^5

0 <= A[i] <= 10^5

## Input Format

First and only argument is the Integer Array, A.

## Output Format

Return an Integer, denoting the total amount of water that can be trapped in these valleys

## Example Input

**Input 1:**
```
A = [0, 1, 0, 2]
```

**Input 2:**
```
A = [1, 2]
```

## Example Output

**Output 1:**
```
1
```

**Output 2:**
```
0
```

## Example Explanation

**Explanation 1:**

1 unit is trapped on top of the 3rd element.

**Explanation 2:**

No water is trapped.
